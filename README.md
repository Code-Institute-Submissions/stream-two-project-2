# Code Institute Stream Two Project

This is a project website for Code Institute Full Stack Development course Stream Two. It is a flask-based data dashboard project using d3 and Crossfilter, designed to present a set of data in a way which is clear and informative for the site user. The data which I have chosen to use is a list of match results from the World Snooker Championship, during the time that the event has been played at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield (from 1977 to the present day).

## Flask Project

The site development began with the creation of a Flask project. This was then deployed to GitHub along with the README.md file and a skeleton HTML template.
